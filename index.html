           <h2><span>About Me</span></h2>
           <p>
          Hey! I'm <strong>Emma</strong>. <br> Let me show you my life, just one
          day of it. Before I go into it, here is a bit of background info on
          me. I am a proud mama to a 4 year old girl, who is showing me more
          about life than I ever knew. One thing she shows me is that<i> it is
          better to live through life in awe, living in the light and admiring
          the beauty of <strong>every little thing</strong> you come across.</i>
        </p>
        <p> I am married to a funny, outlandish man. we have been partners in
          crime for almost <u>8 years now</u>. Marriage is hard but it is worth
          every bit of that effort in the end.
     Some of my favorite things to do include, but not limited to:
            Crocheting, watching TV, reading books, going on hikes and pretty
            much being outdoors in what ever capacity I can be. I also enjoy
            gardening and travelling. Well, I enjoy the idea of travelling but
            I don't get to do it as much as I would hope to.</p>
            <p>
              Follow me while I tell you about my day and how wonderful it was! One day out of many in
               a life filled with laughter, yarn and the great outdoors  </p>

<p>
I tend to wake up around 8:00 in the morning. I would like to wake up earlier
than that, but I tend to be a bit of a night owl. I would sleep in more but I have
my daughter and husband who require me to wake up early enough to get the day started.
<br> I tend to rush out of the house in the mornings but I love the days when I
get to actually make breakfast and sit at the table to eat it. Today was a
typical day where I didn't even eat breakfast. The important factor that I needed
to make sure had happen, was that my daughter ate breakfast. Then we took my husband
to work</p>

      <p>Today i went to the library for a free yoga class. I've been to several
        of their classes and it was a nice feeling when the yoga instructor
        greeted me as I entered. My daughter tends to follow where I go, at least
        that is the plan but I tend to make plans around her interests. It has
        been only a recent thing to indlude my interests in our daily lives. So
        she has been coming with me to yoga lately, she watches my tablet while
        i get my zen on. </p>
      <p>I realize i am doing too much journalling for this project. so I am going
        to reign that in a bit. haha!! </p>
        <p> next, we spent about an hour at the library and I crocheted while my
          daughter played with toys and the computers they have for the kids.

    It was lunch time and we gathered our things to leave and the rain
        started to fall on us! I get my daughter in the car when i realized that
        i left my yoga mat in the library. so I got double soaked due to the
        yoga mat rescue of 2018.</p>
        <p> I forgot to mention that before I went to the library, i wanted
          to take my daughter to a park to run around and burn off some energy.
          I didnt know of any parks off hand so i used the <u><i>"trusty"</i></u>
         google to help me find one. I was led to random parking lots <strong>
           TWICE!</strong> Before I finally came across a hole in the wall park.

           <h3>Emma's Love for Hole in the Wall type of places: An Explanation.
           </h3>

<p> There is something about finding a diamond in the rough that I get a thrill
  in doing. I think to see a dingy shopping center and see a resturant between
  the trashy shops just thrills me. Why you ask? Because I have a theory that in
  every trashy shopping center, there is at least one great place with in those
  sleazy dwellings. My favorite resturants are within dingy shopping centers.
  and I even enjoy seeking out those kind of places in other industries too.
  So when I turned a corner and saw a bunch of dead end streets and piles of trash
  with old couches, I didnt know what to expect. until I drove further and saw the sign
  for a park! It was a hole in the wall park!! <u>HOW WONDERFUL!!</u> <p> If you are interested,
    I would like to recommend a hole in the wall type of place. If you are a fan of cinemas
    i would highly recommend going to St. Andrews Cinema in St. Charles, MO. It
    is a super nice theater and most importantly, it is a dollar theater!! YES!!</p>
